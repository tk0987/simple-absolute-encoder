# simple-absolute-encoder
for cnc and other apps

If you do not have cash for absolute encoders, then you can build your own.

the setup:

glue small magnet at the end of a screw, and position hall sensor close to it. then use ADC of your hardware to get the actual position

# ADC can be noisy

so, then make 1000 measurements (lets say) and make an average. shall work
